Command line for the win
This is an optional project in which i put my command lne skills to a test. As i
completed the game i took screenshots of each level/ question i passed as
required by the project. All this i did with my local machine.

STEP 1: I gathered all screenshots in one folder.

STEP 2: I open my cmd in windows and used the sftp command provided on the
sandbox page to connect to my sandbox

STEP 3: After the connection was established through sftp i then navigated to my
alx-system_engineering-devops directory, created a sub directory called
command_line_for_the_win.

STEP 4: In this new directoryy i uploaded all my screenshots using the the sftp
command put. However to save time i used mput *.png to upload all .png files in
one go.

STEP 5: I confirmed the files uploaded successfully by logging into my sandbox
using an ssh connection(feel free to use webterm or you fav method)

STEP 6: I wrote this README.md in emacs through my putty ssh connection

STEP 7: Push to github.

DO NOT FORGET TO NAME YOUR SCREENSHOTS ACCORDINGLY AS YOU TAKE THEM
